    " - When you submit your code, make sure that every cell runs without returning an error.\n",
    " - Once you have the results you need, edit out any extraneous code and outputs.\n",
    " - *Do not rewrite code* if it doesn't need to be rewritten. For example, all the import statements you should need are in the first code block. Do not redo those in your analysis."
